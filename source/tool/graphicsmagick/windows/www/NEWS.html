<li><p>GraphicsMagick is participating in Google's oss-fuzz project since
February 4 2018 due to the contributions and assistance of Alex
Gaynor and Paul Kehrer. The issues list is available at
<a class="reference external" href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/list">https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/list</a> under search term
&quot;graphicsmagick&quot;.  Issues are available for anyone to view and

the oss-fuzz issues list for details.</p></li>
<li><p>GraphicsMagick has been participating in Synopsys's Coverity program
for free software projects since 2015.  There has been a continuing
objective to keep outstanding defects at 0, or very close to 0.
Information about the Coverity status may be found at
<a class="reference external" href="https://scan.coverity.com/projects/graphicsmagick">https://scan.coverity.com/projects/graphicsmagick</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>TIFF: Fixed multiple heap and stack buffer overflows (directed by
the source EXIF profile) while writing EXIF into the native TIFF
IFD.</p></li>
<li><p>FITS: Fix problem that the FITS reader could return invalid image
frames with rows or columns set to zero. Other code in the library
crashes, or even asserts, if invalid image frames with rows or
columns set to zero are returned.</p></li>
<li><p>Coverity fixes: Various fixes for Coverity issues raised after the
update to version 2023.12.2.</p></li>
<li><p>Clang Analyzer (scan-build) fixes: Various fixes for new issues
discovered by Clang Analyzer.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Bug fixes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>configure.ac: Fix a shell syntax error.</p></li>
<li><p>GCC 14: Eliminate some new warnings which appeared while in -Wall
mode.</p></li>
<li><p>JPEG: FormatJPEGSamplingFactors() now properly handles the number of
samples for each colorspace.</p></li>
<li><p>JXL: Additional validations of color channel and alpha channel
depth.</p></li>
<li><p>TGA: Fix issues discovered by Coverity.</p></li>
<li><p>TGA: Fix writing TGA with opacity values in palette.</p></li>
<li><p>TGA: Default orientation is (again) TopLeftOrientation.</p></li>
<li><p>TIFF: Verify that TIFFTAG_BITSPERSAMPLE is within a rational range.</p></li>
<li><p>TXT: Eliminate use of an uninitialized-value in GetColorTuple().</p></li>
<li><p>XML: Improve detection of if the deprecated HTTP and FTP protocols
are supported by libxml2.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>New Features:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Add support for reading the pre-rendered image from the Open Raster
(&quot;ORA&quot;) format. Actual rendering of Open Raster is not supported.</p></li>
<li><p>Add support for Dune HD AAI Image (aka Auburn Animation Image) image
format (&quot;AAI&quot;).</p></li>
<li><p>Add support for a --version option, which produces GNU style summary
version output.</p></li>
<li><p>Identify output now indicates if the image is opaque.</p></li>
<li><p>WebP: Add support for '-define webp:exact=true' to preserve exact
RGB values under transparent areas while writing WebP format.
Enable this automatically when lossless is enabled.  If lossless is
enabled, this option may be used to disable exact mode.</p></li>
<li><p>PerlMagick: Add AccessDefinition(), AddDefinition(),
AddDefinitions(), and RemoveDefinitions() methods to supporting
adding, updating, removing definitions.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>API Updates:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Magick++/STL.h: The deprecated std::unary_function is no longer used
given C++'11 or later. Continued use of it caused too many issues
due to an abundance of warnings.</p></li>
<li><p>Wand API PixelSetQuantumColor(): The color argument is now a const
pointer.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Behavior Changes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The graphical progress indication in the X11 sub-apps 'animate' and
'display' is disabled due to discovering a tremendous performance
impact while rendering text under Ubuntu 22.04 LTS.  The underlying
cause of the performance impact is not yet known.  A text-based
progress output to the program's console is available via
<cite>-monitor</cite>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Windows Delegate Updates/Additions:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Zip support is obtained from existing zlib contrib/minizip source code.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Build Changes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Libzip is now supported in the build in order to support the ORA
format.  Please note that this library often depends on a large
crypto library such as OpenSSL, although crypto is not required to
read the ORA format.</p></li>
<li><p>The VisualMagick build is modified to use existing minizip source
files to support the ORA format.</p></li>
<li><p>fuzzing/oss-fuzz-build.sh: Continued improvements to the oss-fuzz
build script, which builds almost all 3rd party libraries that
GraphicsMagick depends on.</p></li>
<li><p>Improve the build for Mingw-w64.  Remove mention from the
documentation regarding the original MinGW (for which the build
still works) given that the project seems to be defunct and
unusable.</p></li>
<li><p>FPX: Support building with libfpx (&quot;FlashPIX&quot;) again. FlashPIX is
not recommended for any production work due to libfpx having a
defective API, bad behavior, and many implementation issues
(especially memory leaks).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Behavior Changes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>MagickMaxFileSystemBlockSize: Place an arbitrary limit (4,194,304
bytes) on maximum filesystem block size.</p></li>
</ul>

<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id4">1.3.43 (March 23, 2024)</a></h1>
<p>Special Issues:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Due to my Internet provider (which I have used since 2001) failing
to support the antiquated technology which hosts GraphicsMagick.org,
and the simple.dallas.tx.us domain I have used since 1994, these
services are now failing.  To make matters worse, due to dramatic
changes in US domain registration in recent years, I do not know how
to update the DNS registrations for simple.dallas.tx.us and my
historical email address may be lost.  As time permits,
GraphicsMagick.org will be re-hosted in the cloud at Linode.</p></li>
<li><p>GraphicsMagick really does need some additional productive
volunteers.  For several years now, the burden has entirely been on
me (Bob Friesenhahn).  I have been sheparding the project for 22
years already (and contributed to ImageMagick and GraphicsMagick
combined for 28 years already).  It is not reasonable to expect
someone with a full time job (and expecting to retire in a few
years) to do all of the work.</p></li>

</ul>
<p>Bug fixes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>JBIG: Add support for 'width', 'height', and 'pixels', resource
limits.  Your mileage may vary.</p></li>
<li><p>WPG: Many fixes based on oss-fuzz testing.</p></li>
<li><p>Ghostscript: When invoking Ghostscript, re-direct Ghostscript stdout
to stderr to avoid output corruption when GM stdout is redirected to
a file.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>New Features:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>File write limit: Add support for a per-file write limit (-limit
write or MAGICK_LIMIT_WRITE).  This imposes a limit on the number of
uncompressed bytes written.  The behavior when the limit is hit is
similar to an unexpected write error, as if the disk is full.</p></li>
<li><p>Resource limit highwater: Resource highwater values are maintained
for successful resource requests and final values are traced
via -debug resource' at the end of program execution.  These values
may be used to understand the most restrictive resource limits which
may be applied while still achieving successful operation.</p></li>
<li><p>BMP: Support BI_PNG compression (PNG inside BMP).</p></li>
<li><p>BMP: Support reading 64 bits-per-pixel.</p></li>
<li><p>BMP: Support reading 48 bits-per-pixel.</p></li>
<li><p>HEIF: Call heif_init() and heif_deinit() if they are
available. Support setting image width limit.</p></li>
<li><p>HRZ: Added support for Slow scan TV format.</p></li>
<li><p>JPEG: Added support for reading and writing lossy or lossless 12
bits, and lossless 16-bits using libjpeg-turbo-3.0</p></li>
<li><p>JXL: Improve JXL reader/writer exception information.</p></li>
<li><p>TIFF: Remove miniswhite/minisblack prohibitions when using Group3
and Group4 compression in order to allow using inverted photometric
from the standard.</p></li>
<li><p>TIFF: Store EXIF IFD and GPS IFD tag information natively in TIFF
sub-IFDs, the same as it would be produced in a camera supporting
TIFF.  This allows an EXIF profile from HEIF, JPEG, JXL, PNG, WebP,
or from the META coder to be preserved in TIFF.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>API Updates:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>ExpandFilenames(): Fix memory leak of existing allocations if
realloc() fails.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Windows Delegate Updates/Additions:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>libjpeg: Update bundled IJG JPEG sources to version 9f.</p></li>
<li><p>libtiff: Update bundled libtiff sources to version 4.5.1.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Build Changes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Since it seems that OSDN has died, Hepapod is now used to provide a
redundant https-capable Hg service and may provide services that
SourceForge does not offer.  Hg checkouts may now be made from
&quot;<a class="reference external" href="https://foss.heptapod.net/graphicsmagick/graphicsmagick">https://foss.heptapod.net/graphicsmagick/graphicsmagick</a>&quot;.</p></li>
<li><p>Autotools-based build: pkg-config provided data is now used to the
maximal extent possible.  However, if pkg-config fails to provide
useful data, then the previously existing tests will still prevail.
Document that <cite>PKG_CONFIG='pkg-config --static' ./configure</cite> should
reveal the private library dependencies needed for a fully-static
build to succeed.</p></li>
<li><p>Autotools-based build: Base decision on if OpenMP is supported on
the '_OPENMP' pre-processor define.</p></li>
<li><p>Autotools-based build: No longer search for (and use) libtrio by
default.  The user now needs to request using it.</p></li>
<li><p>Autotools-based build: Fixes for autoconf-2.72.  Bootstrapped using
Autoconf 2.69, Automake 1.16.5, and Libtool 2.4.7.</p></li>
<li><p>oss-fuzz build: The fuzzing/oss-fuzz-build.sh is re-written in order
to support almost all possible dependency libraries.  For example,
JXL and HEIF (with HEIC and AVIF reader support) are now included in
oss-fuzz testing.</p></li>

<p>Bug fixes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>TIFF: Default the alpha channel to type EXTRASAMPLE_UNASSALPHA(2).</p></li>
<li><p>BMP: Many fixes for reading esoteric BMP sub-formats.</p></li>
<li><p>TranslateTextEx(): Revert change so now a NULL pointer is returned
when given an empty string.  Some algorithms (e.g. montage) were
depending on this!.</p></li>
<li><p>PAM: Fix reading comments.</p></li>
<li><p>PNG: Added Add missing module aliases &quot;PNG00&quot;, &quot;PNG48&quot;, &quot;PNG64&quot;, so
it is again possible to request these subformats directly.</p></li>
<li><p>TIFF: For common formats with the required number of channels, but
one is an 'unspecified' channel, promote unspecified alpha to
unassociated alpha so that the alpha channel is not ignored.</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;Magick&quot; command line emulation: Eliminate duplicate utility name
output in error messages</p></li>
</ul>
<p>New Features:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>BMP: Added the ability to read and write BMP using JPEG compression.

<p>Behavior Changes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Decided to <em>not</em> deprecate the ability to extend existing image
attribute text by calling SetImageAttribute() multiple times. There
are too many subtle usages of this feature.  The annoying printf
introduced in 1.3.41 has been disabled.</p></li>

<p>New Features:</p>
<ul class="simple">

(still no writer support).</p></li>
<li><p>LOG: Added function IsEventLogged() to report if a particular event
will be logged.  Us this as much as possible throughout the software
to replace use of IsEventLogging().  This avoids a possible
performance hit if any logging is enabled at all and logging
statements are executed which are filtered and produce no output.</p></li>

tests to use hash signature rather than comparison to reduce the
distribution size.</p></li>
<li><p>Blob: The ReadBlobString() function has been re-written to perform
better when reading from files.</p></li>
<li><p>JXL: The JXL coder is updated to compile with what will likely
become JXL 0.8.0.  Support for 16-bit 'short' samples, 16-bit
'float' samples, and 32-bit float samples added.  Support for
reading and writing ICC, EXIF, and XMP profiles added.</p></li>
<li><p>MIME: GM &quot;magick&quot; to MIME mappings have been added for apng, avif,
bmp, ico, and webp (regardless of if they are supported).</p></li>
<li><p>XPM: The XPM reader performance is dramatically improved and is
observed to be 32x faster when reading a medium-sized XPM file
(e.g. the GraphicsMagick logo).</p></li>

<li><p>The Microsoft Visual Studio build has not been updated for this
release (although it does compile and the results do work fine) and
I might not be providing any Windows installation packages
corresponding to this release.  The problem is that the third-party
'delegate' libraries are out of date and they need to be updated
since some of them are known to contain severe security
vulnerabilities.  Several third-party 'delegate' libraries now
require real C'99 support, which means that Visual Studio 2015 or
later would be required to build them.  The 'configure' program used
to build the Visual Studio project files needs to be updated since
otherwise a 20 minute project upgrade cycle is needed when using
Visual Studio 2019, and to make minor path changes to avoid a
multitude of project-file warnings while building.  The installation
requirements for Visual Studio 2015 or later are different (related
to run-time &quot;redistributables&quot;, which are now very onerous) and so
the Inno Setup installer needs some minor (or major) changes.  Many
pleas for assistance have been made (e.g. even to help with testing
to see if the software executes at all) but thus far the Microsoft
Windows user community has not been helpful with regards to the
Microsoft Visual Studio build.</p></li>

GraphicsMagick ChangeLog file, Mercurial repository commit log, and
the oss-fuzz issues list for details.</p></li>
<li><p>WPG: Fixes for heap buffer overflow.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Bug fixes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>ConstituteImage(): Set image depth appropriately based on the
storage size specified by StorageType and QuantumDepth.</p></li>
<li><p>GetImageBoundingBox(): Fix problem that MagickTrimImage with extreme
fuzz values could produce an image with negative width.</p></li>
<li><p>ImageToFile(): Improve error handling to avoid possible deferred
deletion of temporary files, causing unexpected excessive use of
temporary file space.</p></li>
<li><p>JNG: Add validations for alpha compression method values and use
this information to enforce decoding using the appropriate
sub-format (rather than auto-detecting the format).  Also, address
memory leaks which may occur if the sub-decoder does something other
than was expected.</p></li>
<li><p>MagickCondSignal(): Improvements to conditional signal handler
registration (which avoids over-riding signal handlers previously
registered by an API user).</p></li>
<li><p>ModifyCache(): Fix memory leak.</p></li>
<li><p>ReadCacheIndexes(): Don't blunder into accessing a null pointer if
the using code has ignored a previous error report bubled-up from
SetNexus().</p></li>
<li><p>MNG: When doing image scaling and the image width or height is 1
then always use simple pixel replication as per the MNG
specification.</p></li>
<li><p>MVG: Fixes to 'push clip-path foo' and 'pop clip-path foo' parsing
to eliminate a class of malign behavior.</p></li>
<li><p>MVG: Place an aribrary limit on stroke dash polygon unit maximum
length in order to avoid possibly rendering &quot;forever&quot;.</p></li>
<li><p>PCL: No longer attempt to handle reading HP PCL format via the
external 'hp2xx' program since it seems worthless for that task.</p></li>
<li><p>PS: Fix corrupt image when writing PseudoClass image with a colormap
larger than two entries as bilevel.</p></li>
<li><p>SVG: Memory leak fixes.</p></li>
<li><p>SVG reader: Now support 'ping' support so the identify command works
as expected.</p></li>
<li><p>TIFF: WEBP compression only supports a depth of 8 so force that
value.</p></li>
<li><p>Wand MagickSetSamplingFactors(): Correct formatting of sampling
factors string.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>New Features:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Logging is now fully programmable.</p></li>
<li><p>DPX format: Support dpx:swap-samples-read define which behaves
similar to dpx:swap-samples, but is only applied when reading, as
well as dpx:swap-samples-write, which is only applied when
writing. This provides for use when there is both reading and
writing in the same operation (otherwise the final result was no
effect!).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>API Updates:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>magick/api.h: Add &quot;magick/enum_strings.h&quot; to API headers.</p></li>
<li><p>New log settings accessor C functions: SetLogDefaultFileName(),
SetLogDefaultFormat(), SetLogDefaultOutputType(),
SetLogDefaultLogMethod(), SetLogDefaultLimit(),
SetLogDefaultGenerations(), SetLogDefaultEventType().  These
functions allow a program to set the same parameters which may be
set by loading a &quot;log.mgk&quot; function.  If a default logging callback
was provided via SetLogDefaultLogMethod() such that MethodOutput is
used, then the search for a &quot;log.mgk&quot; is avoided entirely.</p></li>
<li><p>New log settings accessor C++ functions: SetLogDefaultFileName(),
SetLogDefaultFormat(), SetLogDefaultOutputType(),
SetLogDefaultLogMethod(), SetLogDefaultLimit(),
SetLogDefaultGenerations(), SetLogDefaultEventType().  These C++
functions just pass through to the equivalent C functions and
provide the same benefits.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Feature improvements:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>A simple resource-limit respecting memory allocator has been
developed for internal use wherever arbitrarily-large amounts of
memory might be requested.  This will gradually be added wherever it
appears to be needed.  The memory resource limits are at the overall
process level.  The MVG/SVG rendering code is updated to use this
new allocator.  Almost all of the coders (image format
readers/writers) have now been updated to use this new allocator.
This means that '-limit memory 300MB' would be more complete and
meaningful now.  Temporary allocations by the image processing
algorithms (other than for the images themselves) are still not
accounted for in the resource limiting.</p></li>
<li><p>MVG Renderer / DrawImage(): Use resource-limit respecting memory
allocators for remaining large memory allocations.</p></li>
<li><p>PNG writer: Don't skip optional Exif identifier code if it isn't present.</p></li>
<li><p>DPX reader/writer: decode/encode of 10-bit packed DPX is now twice
as fast due to code simplification.</p></li>
<li><p>TIFF reader: Apply the same resource limits to TIFF tile sizes as
apply to the image itself.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Windows Delegate Updates/Additions:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>None</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Build Changes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>configure.ac: Update syntax to avoid using deprecated syntax
according to Autoconf 2.69.  Also added copious m4 quoting.</p></li>
<li><p>Magick++ Drawable base class no longer uses std::unary_function when
compiled using C++'17 or later, since this feature has been removed
from the language.</p></li>
<li><p>Support the configure option --disable-compressed-files to disable
automatic decompress of gzip and bzip2 compressed files (e.g. files
with extension 'gz' or 'bz2', and sometimes 'svgz', but sometimes
posing as some other format).  It turns out that there are some
extremely compressed files (e.g. over 1000x compression ratio) which
can take a long time to decompress and produce large temporary
files.  We currently normally wait for the whole file to be
decompressed before decoding it.  The only exception is for coders
with native 'blob' support and which do not require seeking, and
that the user forced forced the format by adding a magick prefix
like &quot;DPX:file.dpx&quot; to avoid the automatic file format detection.</p></li>
<li><p>Support the configure option --without-gs to disable reading PS,
EPS, and PDF formats via an external Ghostscript delegate program.
This corresponds to the HasGS definition in the source code.</p></li>
<li><p>Support the configure option --without-gdi32 to support disabling
use of the Microsoft Windows gdi32 library if it is not wanted.</p></li>
<li><p>The Automake-based test suite now applies a memory limit of 128MB
for the Q8, or 256MB for the Q16, or 512MB for the Q32 build, as
well as setting a disk space limit of 0.  The limits place an upper
bound on the resources required, while assuring that tests do pass
with resource limits applied, while also assuring that disk-based
pixel-cache files are not used.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Behavior Changes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Previously the formatting settings from &quot;log.mgk&quot; were only used
when writing to a file, or to the console, via a file handle.  Now
the log formatting has been normalized so that the settings provided
by &quot;log.mgk&quot; (or SetLogDefaultFormat()) will always be used.  It is
possible this may result in some formatting changes.</p></li>
<li><p>In the Windows Visual Studio build, the ProvideDllMain option is now
disabled by default (can still be enabled) since it causes
InitializeMagick() to be invoked prior to when the program's main()
routine is called, thereby blocking configuration activities or use
of InitializeMagickEx().  With this change it is even more
imperative that InitializeMagick() be explicitly invoked by all
programs using GraphicsMagick.</p></li>

<p>Special Issues:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>It has been discovered that the 'ICU' library (a perhaps 30MB C++
library) which is now often a libxml2 dependendency causes huge
process initialization overhead.  This is noticed as unexpected
slowness when GraphicsMagick utilities are used to process small to
medium sized files.  The time to initialize the 'ICU' library is
often longer than the time that GraphicsMagick would otherwise
require to read the input file, process the image, and write the
output file.  If the 'ICU' dependency can not be avoided, then make
sure to use the modules build so there is only impact for file
formats which require libxml2.  Please lobby the 'ICU' library
developers to change their implementation to avoid long start-up
times due to merely linking with the library.</p></li>

<p>Security Fixes:</p>
<ul class="simple">

fixes to list here.  Please consult the GraphicsMagick ChangeLog
file, Mercurial repository commit log, and the oss-fuzz issues list
for details.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Bug fixes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Fix broken definition of ResourceInfinity which resulted in that
GetMagickResource() would return -1 rather than the maximum range
value for the return type as documented. (problem added by the
1.3.32 release).</p></li>
<li><p>ModifyCache(): Re-open the pixel cache if the cache rows/columns do
not match the owning image rows/columns.</p></li>
<li><p>Fix DisplayImages() return status.  The return status was inverted.</p></li>
<li><p>HISTOGRAM: Histogram once again includes the histogram as a text
comment.  This became broken by previous security fixes.</p></li>
<li><p>PICT: Fixed heap buffer overuns reported multiple sources.</p></li>
<li><p>JNG: Detect when JPEG encoder has failed and throw an exception.</p></li>
<li><p>MVG/DrawImage(): Performs even more parsing validations.</p></li>
<li><p>Clang static analyzer fixes: A great many fixes were made based on
problem reports by the Clang static analyzer.</p></li>
<li><p>Visual Studio static analyzer fixes: A great many fixes were made
based on problem reports by the Visual Studio 2019 static analyzer.
Many of these may improve the robustness of 64-bit code.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>New Features:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>GRADIENT/GradientImage(): Improved accuracy of gradient levels as
well as dramaticaly improving performance.  Output PseudoClass
images if we can.  Add support for using the image 'gravity'
attribute as well as the &quot;gradient:direction&quot; definition to produce
gradient vector directions corresponding to SouthGravity (the
previously-existing default), NorthGravity, WestGravity,
EastGravity, NorthWestGravity, NorthEastGravity, SouthWestGravity,
and SouthEastGravity.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>API Updates:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>InitializeMagickEx(): New function which may be used in place of
InitializeMagick() to initialize GraphicsMagick.  This
initialization function returns an error status value, may update a
passed ExceptionInfo structure with error information, and provides
an options parameter which supports simple bit-flags to tailor
initialization.  The signal handler registrations are skipped if the
MAGICK_OPT_NO_SIGNAL_HANDER flag is set in the options.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Feature improvements:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Replace use of non-reentrant legacy POSIX functions with reentrant
equivalents.</p></li>
<li><p>Timing of image reads should now be very accurate.  The timer was
sometimes not stopped as soon as it should be.</p></li>
<li><p>PICT: The PICT reader is working pretty good now.  It handles all
the PICT image files I have available to me.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Windows Delegate Updates/Additions:</p>

<li><p>None</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Build Changes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Visual Studio Build: Configure program now provides a checkbox to
enable common optimizations for better performance.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Behavior Changes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>POSIX Signals: Use the normal termination signal handler for SIGXCPU
and SIGXFSZ so that ulimit or setrlimit(2) may be used to apply CPU
(RLIMIT_CPU) and output file size (RLIMIT_FSIZE) limits with the
normal cleanup, and without dumping core. Note that any output files
currently being written may be truncated and files being written by
external programs (e.g. Ghostscript) might be left behind unless
they are to a temporary file assigned by GraphicsMagick.</p></li>
<li><p>Some private string and integer constants were removed from the
apparent library ABI.  Some private functions were marked static and
removed from the apparent library ABI.  This is mentioned because
someone is sure to notice and be concerned about it.</p></li>
<li><p>The remaining private content in installed header files was moved
into -private.h header files which are not installed.  This should
not be cause for concern but is mentiond because someone is sure to
notice and be concerned about it.</p></li>

<p>Special Issues:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>It has been discovered that the 'ICU' library (a perhaps 30MB C++
library) which is now often a libxml2 dependendency causes huge
process initialization overhead.  This is noticed as unexpected
slowness when GraphicsMagick utilities are used to process small to
medium sized files.  The time to initialize is often longer than the
time to read the input file, process the image, and write the output
file.  If the 'ICU' dependency can not be avoided, then make sure to
use the modules build.  Please lobby the 'ICU' library developers to
change their implementation to avoid long start-up times due to
merely linking with the library.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Security Fixes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>GraphicsMagick is now participating in Google's oss-fuzz project due
to the contributions and assistance of Alex Gaynor. Since February 4
2018, 343 issues have been opened by oss-fuzz and 331 of those
issues have been resolved.  The issues list is available at

<li><p>BMP reader: Fix heap overflow in 32-bit build due to arithmetic
overflow. Only happens if limits are changed from defaults.</p></li>
<li><p>BMP reader/writer: Improve buffer-size calculations to guard against
buffer overflows.</p></li>
<li><p>DIB reader: Reject files which claim more than 8-bits per pixel but
also claim to be colormapped.</p></li>
<li><p>DIB reader/writer: Improve buffer-size calculations to guard against
buffer overflows.</p></li>
<li><p>MIFF reader: Detect end of file while reading RLE packets.</p></li>
<li><p>MIFF reader: Fix heap overflow (for some files using RLE
compression) caused by a typo in the code.</p></li>
<li><p>MAT writer: Added missing error handling to avoid heap overflow.</p></li>
<li><p>MNG reader: Fixed a small heap buffer overflow.</p></li>
<li><p>SVG reader: Fixed a stack buffer overflow.</p></li>
<li><p>TGA writer: Fix heap overflow when image rows/columns are larger
than 65535.</p></li>
<li><p>TIFF reader: Rationalize tile width/height to reject large tile
sizes which are much larger than the image dimensions.</p></li>
<li><p>TIFF reader: Apply memory resource limits to strip and tile allocations.</p></li>
<li><p>WMF reader: Fixed a division by zero problem.</p></li>
<li><p>XWD reader: Many heap buffer overflows and uses of uninitialized data were fixed.</p></li>
<li><p>Pixel cache: Now apply resource limits to pixel nexus allocations
using the same limits (total pixels, width, height, memory) as
applied to the whole image since some requests are directly
influenced by the input file.  More tests are added for arithmetic
overflow.  Care was taken to minimize performance impact due to the
many extra checks.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Bug fixes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>See above note about oss-fuzz fixes.</p></li>
<li><p>Fixed include order of magick/api.h vs wand/wand_symbols.h.</p></li>

strings refer to existing exception character strings.</p></li>
<li><p>Command-line parser now does not attempt to read a list of filenames
from a file in <a class="reference external" href="mailto:'&#37;&#52;&#48;name">'<span>&#64;</span>name</a>' syntax if the path <a class="reference external" href="mailto:'&#37;&#52;&#48;name">'<span>&#64;</span>name</a>' exists.
Previously it would attempt to read a list of file names from 'name'
even if <a class="reference external" href="mailto:'&#37;&#52;&#48;name">'<span>&#64;</span>name</a>' did exist.</p></li>
<li><p>Rendering: Short-circuit path parsing and return and error
immediately if an error occurs.</p></li>

<p>New Features:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Added support for writing the Braille image format (by Samuel
Thibault).</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p>Microsoft Windows timing information now uses
QueryPerformanceFrequency() and QueryPerformanceCounter() for
increased precision.</p></li>
<li><p>The 'benchmark' command now shows 6 digits (microseconds) of elapsed
time indication.</p></li>
<li><p>The 'time' command now shows 6 digits (microseconds) of elapsed time
indication.</p></li>
<li><p>The logging facility now shows 6 digits (microseconds) of time
resolulution</p></li>
<li><p>Dcraw: When QuantumDepth is greater than 8, pass -6 option to dcraw
so that it returns a 16-bit/sample image.</p></li>
<li><p>Dcraw: If Dcraw supports TIFF format, then request TIFF format in
order to be able to acquire more metatdata.</p></li>
<li><p>Scale algorithm: Eliminate artifacts when scaling an image with
semi-transparent pixels.</p></li>
<li><p>Library metrics: The number of shared library relocations and the
amount of initialized data has been signficantly reduced by
following recommendations from Ulrich Drepper's document <a class="reference external" href="https://akkadia.org/drepper/dsohowto.pdf">How To
Write Shared Libraries</a>.</p>
<p>For comparison, these are the differences in library metrics between
the 1.3.31 and 1.3.32 releases for a simple shared library with all
features supported:</p>
<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 17%" />
<col style="width: 25%" />
<col style="width: 35%" />
<col style="width: 23%" />
</colgroup>

<tr><td><p>1.3.32</p></td>
<td><p>747</p></td>
<td><p>127,936</p></td>
<td><p>3,033,279</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>and these are the differences in library metrics between 1.3.31 and
1.3.32 for a shared library using the modules option (recommended!)
with all features supported:</p>
<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 17%" />
<col style="width: 25%" />
<col style="width: 35%" />
<col style="width: 23%" />

<td><p>119,472</p></td>
<td><p>1,825,651</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>As can be seen, the number of relocations was extreme and has been
reduced to reasonable levels while also diminishing the amount of
initialized data and the total size of the library/program.  Most of
the remaining initialized data (106,648 bytes) and some of the
relocations (65 relocations) may be attributed to the optional X11
animate/display/import support.</p>

<li><p>The test suite now passes even if no fonts are found.</p></li>
<li><p>Configure script does better at finding Windows fonts on non-Windows systems.</p></li>
<li><p>The configure script now supports the option --with-mtmalloc to
enable use of the mtmalloc library as found on Solaris-derived
systems.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Behavior Changes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>AnnotateImage(): No longer implicitly call TranslateText() since
this is not suitable for most use-cases and causes additional

</ul>
<p>API Updates:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>MagickMonitor() is marked as deprecated.  Code should not be using

<p>Feature improvements:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The progress monitor callbacks (registered using MagickMonitor() or
MagickMonitorFormatted()) are serialized via a common semaphore
rather than via critical sections in OpenMP loops.  OpenMP loops are
updated to use OpenMP 'atomic' and 'flush' to update shared loop
variables rather than using a OpenMP 'critical' construct, reducing
contention.  Performance on some targets is observed to have been
improved by this change.</p></li>

<p>Windows Delegate Updates/Additions:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>None</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Build Changes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>There was already a 'compare' command installed with the
'--enable-magick-compat' configure option was used but it did not
function.  Now it functions.  There was no <cite>compare</cite> command in
ImageMagick 5.5.2 and this compare command is only roughly similar
to a <cite>compare</cite> command in some subsequent ImageMagick release.</p></li>
<li><p>Removed Remove Ghostscript library support (--with-gslib) from
configure script.  The 'HasGS' pre-processor defines which were
enabled by this remain in the source code so it is still possible to
use this library if absolutely necessary (e.g. CPPFLAGS=-DHasGS
LIBS=-lgs).</p></li>
<li><p>No longer explicitly link with the OpenMP library when it will be
supplied already due to CFLAGS.</p></li>

<p>Behavior Changes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>JPEG: Libjpeg-turbo is allowed 1/5th the memory resource limit
provided for Graphicsmagick via the cinfo-&gt;mem-&gt;max_memory_to_use
option, which is part of the IJG JPEG API/ABI, but usually not
supported there.  This feature works for libjpeg-turbo 1.5.2 and
later.  Limiting the memory usage is useful since libjpeg-turbo may
otherwise consume arbitrary amounts of memory even before
Graphicsmagick is informed of the image dimensions.</p></li>

reported.</p></li>
<li><p>The magick/pixel_cache.h header is updated to add deprecation
attributes such that code using GetPixels(), GetIndexes(), and
GetOnePixel() will produce deprecation warnings for compilers which
support them.  These functions will not be removed in the 1.3.X
release series and when they are removed, pre-processor macros will
be added so a replacement function is used instead.  There is a
long-term objective to eliminate functionally-redundant pixel cache
functions to only the ones with the best properties since this
reduces maintenance and may reduce the depth of the call stack
(improving performance).</p></li>

<ul class="simple">
<li><p>EscapeParenthesis(): I was notified by Gustavo Grieco of a heap
overflow in EscapeParenthesis() used in the text annotation code.

this function is completely redone.  This issue was assigned
CVE-2016-7447 after the release.</p></li>

CVE-2016-7448 after the release.</p></li>
<li><p>SVG/MVG: Fix another case of CVE-2016-2317 (heap buffer overflow) in

</ul>
<p>Bug fixes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>GetToken(): Fix obscure bug (read beyond end of string buffer)
noticed while parsing a MVG file.  This problem was reported by
Gustavo Grieco.</p></li>
<li><p>MVG rendering: Fix undesired hard errors when some objects were
drawn outside of the image bounds.  Requests to draw objects
entirely outside of the image should be silently ignored.</p></li>
<li><p>MVG/SVG rendering: Fix gradient size sanity checks which were
causing gradient requests to fail.  Due to a design weakness in that
gradient images allocate resources rather than being computations at
point of use, the maximum gradient image size is now hard-limited to
5000x5000 pixels until the design problem is fixed.  Some SVG icons
(as small as 8x8 pixels) authored using Inkscape request absurdly
huge gradients.  Gradient sizes as large as 20,000x20,000 have been
observed in SVG icon files delivered by packages on an Ubuntu Linux

<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id23">1.3.24 (May 30, 2016)</a></h1>
<p>Special Issues:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>A shell exploit (CVE-2016-5118) was discovered associated with a
filename syntax where file names starting with '|' are intepreted as
shell commands executed via popen().  Insufficient sanitization in
the SVG and MVG renderers allows such filenames to be passed through
from potentially untrusted files.  There might be other ways for
untrusted inputs to produce such filenames.  Due to this issue,
support for the feature is removed entirely.</p></li>
<li><p>A shell exploit was discovered associated with the gnuplot delegate
and which is triggered by the 'gplt' entry in delegates.mgk.  A
remote exploit is possible if the attacker can cause a provided SVG
or MVG file to be rendered (or the user opens a provided file).  The
gnuplot program must be installed in order for the exploit to be
successful.  It is strongly recommended to remove this entry in all
delegates.mgk files.</p></li>
<li><p>Due to <a class="reference external" href="http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=53967">GCC bug 53967</a>, several key agorithms (e.g. convolution)
may execute much faster (e.g. 2-3X) for x86-64 and/or when SSE is
enabled for floating point math (<cite>-mfpmath=sse</cite>) if the GCC option
<cite>-frename-registers</cite> is used. Default 32-bit builds do not
experience the problem since they use '387 math.  It is not clear in
what version of GCC this problem started but it was not noticed by
the developers until the GCC 4.6 timeframe.  Other compilers do not
suffer from this bug.  Please lobby the GCC project to fix this
embarrassing performance bug.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Security Fixes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>BLOB: Remove support for reading input from a shell command, or
writing output to a shell command, by prefixing the specified
filename (containing the command) with a '|'.  This feature provided
a remote shell execution opportunity.</p></li>
<li><p>DIB: Fixed out of bounds reads.  Added more header validations.</p></li>
<li><p>JNG: File size limits are enforced.</p></li>
<li><p>MAT: Fixed denial of service opportunity.  Fix hang on corrupt deflate stream.</p></li>
<li><p>META: Fixed out of bounds reads and writes.</p></li>
<li><p>MIFF: Fixed thrown assertion.</p></li>
<li><p>MSL: Ignore the file extension on MSL files.  It is necessary to add
a &quot;msl:&quot; prefix to MSL files to read the as an image.</p></li>
<li><p>MVG: No longer assume that files ending with extension &quot;.mvg&quot; are
MVG files.  MVG parsing does more validity checking on its input.
Assure that enough PrimitiveInfo structures are allocated in advance
to support a given vector path (heap overflow problem).</p></li>
<li><p>PCX: Fixed unreasonable memory allocation due to intentionally
corrupt file.</p></li>
<li><p>PDB: Fixed a heap buffer overflow and out of bounds read.</p></li>
<li><p>PICT: Fixed an out of bounds write.</p></li>

violations (CVE-2016-2317 and CVE-2016-2318).  Also fixed endless
loop, unexpectedly large memory allocation, divide by zero, and
recursion issues.</p></li>
<li><p>TIFF: Fixed an assertion while reading.  Fixed benign heap overflow.</p></li>
<li><p>TMP: Adding a &quot;tmp:&quot; prefix to a filename no longer removes the file
since this seems dangerous.</p></li>
<li><p>VIFF: Fix excessive memory allocation with intentionally corrupted input file.</p></li>
<li><p>XCF: Fixed a heap buffer overflow.</p></li>
<li><p>XPM: Fixed several heap buffer overflows, and out of bound
reads/writes.  Also fixed a case of excessive memory allocation.</p></li>
<li><p>delegate.mgk: The default delegate.mgk file has been pared down in
order to reduce security exposure.</p></li>
<li><p>gnuplot ('gplt' delegate in delegates.mgk): Support for rendering
gnuplot files is removed since the format is inherently insecure.</p></li>
<li><p>File names: File names starting with a '|' character are no longer
interpreted as shell commands to be executed as input or output.</p></li>

the ABI due to previous use of inline methods and no place to put
the new flags.</p></li>
<li><p>Magick++ Image::extent(): New method to place image on sized

<li><p>Resource limits: Added support for image Width and Height limits.
Default image Width and Height limits are based on the range of a
32-bit signed integer, even for 64-bit builds which may have
sufficient numeric range to image an entire galaxy.  Limits may be
increased as desired.</p></li>

warnings reported by libtiff are thrown as warning exceptions so
that they may be caught or will be reported at the gm
command-line.</p></li>
<li><p>Windows Exceptions: A handler is registered (due to calling
InitializeMagick()) to capture Windows Exceptions in a similar
manner to the existing POSIX signal handler.  If an application is
using the library and wants to provide its own Windows exception
handling, then it should make any changes after invoking
InitializeMagick().</p></li>

support.</p></li>
<li><p>Coders: Added BrokenCoderClass to mark coders which often
malfunction or are not very useful in their current condition.</p></li>
<li><p>Composition: Added HardLight composition operator, which is now
used by PSD and XCF formats, and available via command line,
Magick++ API, PerlMagick API, and Wand API.</p></li>
<li><p>Composition: Added ScreenCompositePixels composition operator.</p></li>
<li><p>Composition: Added missing Photoshop separable compositing
operations, Overlay, Exclusion, ColorBurn, ColorDodge, SoftLight,
LinearBurn, LinearDodge, LinearLight, VividLight, PinLight,
HardMix.</p></li>

<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id28">1.3.19 (December 31, 2013)</a></h1>
<p>Special Issues:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Due to <a class="reference external" href="http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=53967">GCC bug 53967</a>, several key agorithms (e.g. convolution)
may execute much faster (e.g. 2-3X) for x86-64 and/or when SSE is
enabled for floating point math (<cite>-mfpmath=sse</cite>) if the GCC option
<cite>-frename-registers</cite> is used. Default 32-bit builds do not
experience the problem since they use '387 math.  It is not clear
in what version of GCC this problem started but it was not noticed
by the developers until the GCC 4.6 timeframe.  Other compilers do
not suffer from this bug.</p></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Security Fixes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>EPT: Fix crash observed when Ghostscript fails to produce useful
output.  This was particularly noticeable when Ghostscript was not
installed.  This crash could be used to cause denial of service.</p></li>
<li><p>PNG: With libpng 1.6.X, avoid a crash while copying a PNG with a
&quot;known incorrect ICC profile&quot;.  This crash could be used to cause
denial of service.</p></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Bug fixes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Build: Fix cross-compilation for MinGW64 on Linux build machine.</p></li>
<li><p>Build: configure FreeType test no longer insists that
&lt;freetype/freetype.h&gt; can be included.</p></li>
<li><p>CMS profile: Only delete the CMS transform if it is non-null.
Fixed assertion observed when lcms returned a null profile and
GraphicsMagick attempted to deallocate it.</p></li>
<li><p>Drawing: Improve error handling logic so that drawing returns
quickly on pixel access errors rather than plowing on ahead.  This
avoids problems with SVGs which take seemingly forever to render.</p></li>
<li><p>Drawing via C/C++ APIs: <cite>BevelJoin</cite> no longer causes a MVG parsing
error.</p></li>
<li><p>EPT: Fix crash observed when Ghostscript fails to produce useful
output.  This was particularly noticeable when Ghostscript was not
installed.</p></li>
<li><p>OpenMP: Revert use of omp_set_dynamic() since it caused
performance issues when using GCC's GOMP implementation and the
number of threads to use is specified.</p></li>
<li><p>EXIF profile: Support the <cite>SubjectArea</cite> EXIF tag.</p></li>
<li><p>MIFF writer: PseudoClass format was written incorrectly for depth
greater than 8.</p></li>
<li><p>MIFF writer: RLE compressed format used inverted alpha from the
other subformats contrary to the MIFF specification.</p></li>
<li><p>MIFF reader: Fixes to be able to read MIFF written by
ImageMagick 6.X, including DirectClass grayscale images (except
for RLE compressed).</p></li>
<li><p>Mosaic: Fixed unsigned underflow problem with -mosaic when page
offset is negative and exceeds image width or height, resulting in
assertions, out of memory errors, or pixel cache limit errors.</p></li>
<li><p>PDF: Consistently initialize Image page width and height to image
width and height.  While general to all of GraphicsMagick, this
change is to assure that the PDF writer computes page dimensioning
consistently.  PDF page dimensioning was wrong if the image had
been resized with -geometry &quot;100%&quot;.</p></li>
<li><p>PAM: Fix MAXVAL scaling when reading PAM images.  PAM was only
working correctly for images with 256 or 64k levels.</p></li>
<li><p>PNM: PGM &quot;P2&quot; format writer wrote bad output for 8-bit depth.</p></li>
<li><p>PNG: With libpng 1.6.X, avoid a crash while copying a PNG with a
&quot;known incorrect ICC profile&quot;.</p></li>
<li><p>PNG: Q8 GM build now correctly reads 16-bit PNG files.</p></li>
<li><p>TIFF writer: Try to avoid writing more than 32k strips per image
by increasing rows-per-strip since some programs fail to read
images with more than 32k strips per image.</p></li>
<li><p>TIM reader: PSX TIM reports 8-bit depth (rather than 16).</p></li>
<li><p>TTF font rendering: Improve FreeType rendering error logic so that
rendering returns immediately on pixel access errors rather than
plowing on ahead.</p></li>
<li><p>TTF font rendering: Support rendering UTF-8 up to 21-bit code
points.  Was only supporting 16-bit code points.</p></li>
<li><p>Wand API: DrawSetStrokeDashArray() / DrawGetStrokeDashArray(), fix
failure to work properly due to this code path never being tested.</p></li>
<li><p>Windows Ghostscript: 64-bit GraphicsMagick no longer requires both
32-bit and 64-bit builds of Ghostscript to be installed in order
to read Postscript and PDF formats.</p></li>
<li><p>XPM reader: Reported depth now depends on the colormap rather than
always claiming to be 16-bit.</p></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>New Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>JPEG: Add support for writing 'XMP' profile.</p></li>
<li><p>PNM: As a simple non-standard extension to the standard PNM and
PAM formats, support writing and reading 32-bit sample depth.
Writing such files is only supported by the Q32 build although
they may be read by any build.</p></li>
<li><p>WebP: Now supports reading and writing Google's WebP format.  This
feature is not currently supported by the Windows Visual Studio
build.</p></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Feature improvements:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Pixel composition based on BlendCompositePixel() is enhanced to
completely eliminate under-color from the blending if the
under-pixel is fully transparent.  Also blends based on the
average opacity of both pixels rather than only the over-pixel.
This change did not result in any change in the GM test suite
results but it is possible that there could be some negative
impact from it.  Please report any issues noticed which are due to
this change.</p></li>
<li><p>X11 <cite>display</cite>: For DirectClass image, use ThumbnailImage() rather
than SampleImage() when creating the panner icon to improve the
quality of the image.</p></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Performance Improvements:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>PNG: <cite>ping</cite> a PNG faster by avoiding reading the image data.</p></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Windows Delegate Updates:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Updated IJG JPEG library to release 9.</p></li>
<li><p>Updated PNG library to release 1.6.8.</p></li>
<li><p>Updated lcms2 library to release 2.5.</p></li>
<li><p>Updated libxml2 library to release 2.9.1.</p></li>
<li><p>Updated FreeType library to release 2.5.2.</p></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Behavior Changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>MIFF: Now writes PseudoClass images correctly when depth is
greater than 8.  This impacts the reader, which will not be able
to read previously written incorrect format correctly.  Images
like this should be very rare.  The solution is to use an older
GraphicsMagick version to convert such images to a valid storage
format (with a depth of 8) so that they may be read with this
version.</p></li>
<li><p>MIFF: Now writes RLE-compressed RGBA images with correct
alpha. This impacts the reader, which will not be able to read
previously written incorrect format correctly. Images like this
should be very rare. A solution is to use an older GraphicsMagick
version to use a compression algorithm other than RLE so that they
are read correctly with this version.  Another solution is to
process problematic images with '-operator Opacity Negate 0' to
invert the alpha channel.</p></li>
<li><p>TIFF: Returns DirectClass images by default for MINISWHITE and
MINISBLACK TIFF formats (rather then colormapped).</p></li>
<li><p>Windows: Also search c:gsfonts for Ghostscript font files.  This
search path is normally hard-coded into Ghostscript binaries and
is a convenient place to put fonts so they may be shared by
multiple Ghostscript versions.</p></li>
<li><p>XPM: Now limits color resolution to 16-bits, even with Q32 build.</p></li>

<p>New Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>GM utility: New 'batch' command was contributed by Kenneth Xu
which supports executing any number of other GM utility
sub-commands in a single invocation in a sort of &quot;batch&quot; script.
Input may be piped from standard input, from a specified file, or
from a 'GM &gt;' command prompt.  This utilities front-end allows any
other program/script to drive 'gm' using a co-process model and
speeds up execution by eliminating utility start-up/shut-down
time.</p></li>
<li><p>WIN64 (64-bit Windows): Windows 64-bit is now officially supported.</p></li>
<li><p>convert/mogrify: Now support -auto-orient to automatically rotate
the image upright for viewing based on its current orientation
setting.  Also support -orient to support setting the current
image orientation.  Please note that the orientation property of
EXIF profiles is not yet updated so the EXIF profile will be wrong
after using -auto-orient.</p></li>
<li><p>C API: AutoOrientImage(), new function to automatically orient
the image so that it is upright for normal viewing.</p></li>
<li><p>Wand API: MagickGetImagePage()/MagickSetImagePage(), new functions

provided.</p></li>
<li><p>The <cite>animate</cite>, <cite>display</cite>, and <cite>identify</cite> commands now report any
error only once, and then proceed to the next file name rather
than quitting.</p></li>
<li><p>Don't change the locale settings in InitializeMagick() since this
may cause problems for international users.  API users are still
responsible for assuring that locale settings don't break floating
point parsing and output (i.e. floating point decimal needs to be
'.' rather than ',').</p></li>
<li><p>RPM build is fixed (PerlMagick build was broken).</p></li>
<li><p>RPM build installs documentation to expected places on Red Hat

<li><p>benchmark command supports a -stepthreads option to execute the
specified command with an increasing number of threads to measure
how an algorithm benefits from threading.  This mode includes a
column to show the speedup compared with one thread, and the
Karp-Flatt metric</p></li>
<li><p>Added support for invoking &quot;gs-cmyk&quot; and &quot;gs-cmyka&quot; entries in
delegates.mgk when ColorSeparationType or ColorSeparationMatteType
is requested.  These cause Ghostscript to always output CMYK PAM
format (even if the input file was not in CMYK format).</p></li>

<li><p>The -mosaic command now respects the composition option specified
by -compose as well as the image background color specified by

<li><p>The TXT coder now supports multiple image frames.</p></li>
<li><p>For image normalization (-normalize), add support for
histogram-threshold setting to specify the percentage of the
histogram to discard when computing image normalization parameters
(default is 0.1%).  For example <cite>-set histogram-threshold 0.01
-normalize</cite>.</p></li>
<li><p>Added an <cite>INFO</cite> coder which produces textual image description
output similar to <cite>identify</cite> but may be used with convert like &quot;gm
convert myfile info:-&quot;.</p></li>
<li><p>Support application of the PDF crop box via '-define
pdf:use-cropbox=true'.</p></li>
<li><p>For PCL printer output, define pcl:fit-to-page in order for the
printer to scale the image to fit the page.</p></li>

changing the current image characteristics).</p></li>
<li><p>In Wand C API, the functions NewPixelWand(), NewDrawingWand(), and
NewMagickWand() invoke InitializeMagick() automatically in case
user forgets to do so.</p></li>
<li><p>New Wand C API function MagickSetFormat() to allow setting the
file or blob format before it has been read.</p></li>
<li><p>New Wand C API function MagickSetDepth() to set the depth used
when reading from an image format which requires that the depth be
specified in advance.</p></li>

<li><p>For DPX format and packed 10 bits, datums are now represented in
the same (reversed) order for all RGB and YCbCr formats.
Previously YCbCr 4:4:4 formats were not swapping the word datums
because the only real-world files encountered did not swap the
word datums.</p></li>

<p>New Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>MagickWand: New method MagickSetCompressionQuality() to allow
setting the compression quality.</p></li>
<li><p>MagickWand: New method CloneDrawingWand() to deep-copy a drawing
wand.</p></li>

<p>Bug fixes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Composition was failing when the change image overlaps off the
left side of the canvas.</p></li>
<li><p>EPT, PDF, PS: PDF bounding box is sometimes incorrect or not
globally applicable so don't specify bounding box when reading PDF
files.</p></li>
<li><p>OpenMP: Fix (benign) multi-thread cross-contentions (detected by
valgrind's Helgrind).</p></li>
<li><p>TIFF: Fix problem with reading one bit per sample RGB images.</p></li>
<li><p>TIFF: Writer was using rows-per-strip of 8 when writing
JPEG-compressed TIFF.  This does not work for vertical
subsampling, and some TIFF readers insist on 16.  The
rows-per-strip is now required to be a multiple of 16.</p></li>
<li><p>TIFF: In some cases, the TIFF reader and writer were accessing
planar TIFF in row-order rather than plane-order, which resulted
in sever buffering problems in libtiff, and failure when
compression was used.</p></li>
<li><p>-write now works usefully as documented.</p></li>
<li><p>Temporary file name generator was not random enough, resulting in
some file name collisions for GraphicsMagick processes started at
the same time.</p></li>
<li><p>PerlMagick: Fixed Ping on a BLOB.</p></li>
<li><p>GetImageDepth was leaking memory.</p></li>
<li><p>Convert/mogrify -mask option was leaking memory.</p></li>
<li><p>Mogrify -output-directory option was leaking memory.</p></li>
<li><p>DPX: Fixed memory leak encountered when subsampling to 4:2:2.</p></li>
<li><p>DPX: Values read received insuficient scaling, which round-tripped
correctly, but rounded-down excessively if any image processing
was applied.</p></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>New Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Added HRS reader for slow scan TV (contributed by Fojtik Jaroslav).</p></li>
<li><p>Pthreads (POSIX threads) API may now be used under the WIN32 API.</p></li>
<li><p>New access confirmation facility (MagickConfirmAccess) to allow
the API user to monitor and/or block access to files and URLs.
This allows the API user to implement a security policy based on
actual accesses.</p></li>
<li><p>New color matrix function (ColorMatrixImage) to apply a color
matrix similar to Adobe Flash Flash.filters.colorMatrixFilter(),
and Windows GDI+ ColorMatrix class, (order up to 5x5) to the image
pixels.  This is accessible via the -recolor command option.</p></li>
<li><p>Added an IDENTITY coder to return a Hald identity CLUT image of
specified order (e.g. &quot;identity:8&quot;).</p></li>
<li><p>Added a Hald CLUT capability as described at
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.quelsolaar.com/technology/clut.html">http://www.quelsolaar.com/technology/clut.html</a>.  This allows a
color transformation to be easily created and replicated on any
number of images.  The algorithm is accessed by the -hald-clut
option of 'convert' and 'mogrify'.  Original algorithm by Eskil
Steenberg and adapted for GraphicsMagick by Clément Follet, with
additional work by Bob Friesenhahn.</p></li>
<li><p>Added support for the ASC CDL transform.  Available as -asc-cdl
via the 'convert' and 'mogrify' subcommands.  Original
implementation by Clément Follet but considerably re-worked by Bob
Friesenhahn.  Implementation passes the +/- 1 count accuracy
requirement required by the ASC CDL SOP tests.</p></li>
<li><p>Added support for reading CALS Type 1 format (contributed by John
Sergeant).  CALS is a standard raster format used by the US
Department of Defense for storing blueprint images.</p></li>
<li><p>Added a random number generation system based on George
Marsaglia's multiply-with-carry generator.  Somewhat slower than
rand() but produces better random numbers with a period &gt;2^60.
This is a much better random number generator than the C library
rand() and the algorithm is integrated in a way which maximizes
multi-thread performance.</p></li>
<li><p>The 'compare' command now supports a -maximum-error option to
specify the maximum image error so that it may be used to support
boolean logic in automated test scripts.</p></li>
<li><p>For OpenMP-builds, the '-list resource' output now indicates the
number of threads which will be used.</p></li>

<p>Feature improvements:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Image resize now avoids adding &quot;halos&quot; around objects when
resizing an image which contains transparency (patch contributed by
Pavel Merdin).</p></li>
<li><p>DICOM: The DICOM reader is completely re-written and is much more
functional now.  A few features (e.g. RLE compression) are still
missing.  This work is contributed by John Sergeant.</p></li>
<li><p>EXIF: Unprintable characters in EXIF attribute strings are now
returned using three-digit octal notation.  Unknown tags are
identified via their four-character hex value.</p></li>
<li><p>PCL: PCL writer is rewritten to fix many bugs, add support for
compression, add support for 8 bit PseudoClass images, and
dramatically improve usability (work contributed by John Sergeant).</p></li>
<li><p>TIFF: Allow the user to force the returned image to be TrueColor
type for min-is-white and min-is-black TIFF files.</p></li>
<li><p>TIFF: User can now specify the predictor using syntax like
'-define tiff:predictor=2'.</p></li>
<li><p>TIFF: User can now specify the rows-per-strip value when using
JPEG compression.</p></li>
<li><p>TXT: The TXT reader is now capable of reading image files written
by the TXT writer, as well continuing to render ASCII text into an
image (work contributed by Fojtik Jaroslav).</p></li>
<li><p>Utilities &#64;file.txt syntax for including a list of files to use as
an argument now really works as expected.  This may be used to
inject any other text into the command line as well.  As a result,
the 'mogrify' utility may be invoked on thousands of files at once
while obtaining the list of files to process from a text file.</p></li>
<li><p>The 'mogrify' utility now caches argument images so that they are
loaded only once when mogrify is used to process multiple image
files.</p></li>

</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Feature improvements:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>LZW compression is now enabled by default.</p></li>
<li><p>Support industry-standard subsampling notation like &quot;4:2:2&quot;.</p></li>
<li><p>If gm is executed under a traditional alternate name (e.g.
convert), it will invoke the appropriate sub-command. This allows
use of hard links, symbolic links, or just copying 'gm' to the
desired sub-command name in order to achieve 100% ImageMagick 5.5.2
utility compatibility.</p></li>
<li><p>Provide the --enable-magick-compat option when configuring to install
ImageMagick utilities compatibility links.</p></li>
<li><p>Identify -verbose output includes normalized (0.0-1.0) statistics.</p></li>

visual progress indication (and hourglass cursor) while loading images.</p></li>
<li><p>Support writing grayscale TGA files.</p></li>
<li><p>Provide explicit support for Rec 601 and Rec 709 grayscale spaces.</p></li>
<li><p>Include some support for a log RGB space based on the 2.048 density
range as defined for the Cineon Digital Film System.</p></li>
<li><p>Added utilities command-line support for industry standard subsampling
notation like 4:4:4 and 4:2:2.</p></li>
<li><p>Use MAGICK_IOBUF_SIZE to tune the size of the I/O buffer.</p></li>
<li><p>Use -type Bilevel, Grayscale, TrueColor, or TrueColorMatte to
influence the type of image that Ghostscript returns.</p></li>
<li><p>Use '-define tiff:fill-order={msb2lsb|lsb2msb}' to control TIFF bit
fill order.</p></li>
<li><p>The -version option now dumps a feature list as well as the build
options.</p></li>
<li><p>The -endian option now supports the option 'native'.</p></li>
<li><p>A -monitor is added to enable progress monitoring for the command line
utilities.</p></li>
<li><p>Use the -output-directory option to 'mogrify' to send output files to
the specified directory.</p></li>
<li><p>Use the -create-directories option in conjunction with
-output-directory and 'mogrify' to create any necessary subdirectories.</p></li>
<li><p>A Pixels resource limit is added.  Use '-limit Pixels value' to limit
the maximum number of pixels in an image to 'value'.</p></li>
<li><p>The already supported option '-type Optimize' is now honored by
formats that need to choose a subformat based on the properties of
the image. Grueling tests of many/all pixels are not performed
unless '-type Optimize' is supplied.</p></li>
<li><p>Added a a -set option to the composite, convert, display, mogrify,
import commands in order to allow setting an image attribute.</p></li>
<li><p>Display utility no longer defaults to reading from standard input if
stdin is not a tty.</p></li>
<li><p>May now be configured to use the umem memory allocation library
available in Solaris 9, Update 3 and later, or from the portable umem
project.</p></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Coder additions/improvements:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">

to the SMPTE 268M-2003 standard.</p></li>
<li><p>Cineon reader completely rewritten.</p></li>
<li><p>TIFF coder is completely re-written. Now supports reading and
writing RGB, CMYK, and grayscale, scanline-oriented TIFF images
with arbitrary (1 to 32 bits) depth. Includes support for tiled
TIFF, floating point TIFF, LogLuv TIFF, BigTIFF, arbitrary depths,
and associated alpha.</p></li>
<li><p>TIFF coder now supports retrieving and saving XMP profiles.</p></li>
<li><p>MATLAB support is much improved and supports writing as well.</p></li>
<li><p>WPG reader now supports CTM translations.</p></li>
<li><p>ART format now supports writing.</p></li>

<li><p>Support 32-bit raw gray images.</p></li>
<li><p>JP2 coder reads images in YCbCr colorspace and retrieves an embedded
ICC ICM color profile if present.</p></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>API enhancements:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Added ExportImageChannel() and ImportImageChannel() APIs to support
exporting and importing pixel regions with an arbitary range of (1
to 32) bits per quantum.</p></li>
<li><p>Added image leveling methods for Magick++.</p></li>
<li><p>Generalized GetImageAttribute() support for retrieving wildcarded
attributes so that an identify -format specification like
<span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&quot;%[dpx:*]&quot;</span></span> works as expected.</p></li>
<li><p>Incorporated changes changes necessary so that GraphicsMagick can
work with the Ch C/C++ interpreter from SoftIntegration at
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.softintegration.com/">http://www.softintegration.com/</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Added MagickAllocFunctions() to allow the API user to replace the
underlying memory allocator functions.</p></li>
<li><p>Added MagickMalloc() and deprecated AcquireMemory().</p></li>
<li><p>Added MagickCloneMemory() and deprecated CloneMemory().</p></li>
<li><p>Added MagickMallocArray() to safely allocate N items of size S.</p></li>
<li><p>Added MagickRealloc() and deprecated ReacquireMemory().</p></li>
<li><p>Added MagickFree() and deprecated LiberateMemory().</p></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Performance improvments:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The DispatchImage() and ConstituteImage() functions incorporate
special case code for BGR, BGRO, BGRP, RGB, RGBO, and I formats (8
bit only) in order to improve performance dramatically.</p></li>
<li><p>When writing very large JPEG images, don't enable Huffman compression
since doing so requires libjpeg to buffer the entire image in memory.</p></li>
<li><p>When using the 'identify' -verbose option, -verbose must be specified
twice in order to obtain the color count.  This makes normal use of
-verbose much faster.</p></li>
<li><p>Significantly improved read/write speed for bilevel and gray images.</p></li>
<li><p>TIFF I/O is considerably faster.</p></li>
<li><p>Postscript writer is 10-15X faster.</p></li>
<li><p>PNM formats writer is 10-100X faster.</p></li>
<li><p>Rotate by 90 or 270 degrees is 2-9X faster.</p></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Windows-specific improvements/changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>For the MinGW and Cygwin builds, the Magick++ library is forced to
build as a static library since otherwise C++ exceptions don't work.</p></li>
<li><p>MinGW cross-build is available from a Linux or FreeBSD host.</p></li>
<li><p>Determine location of Ghostscript fonts only once in order to improve
performance.</p></li>
<li><p>Updated bzip2 to 1.0.4.</p></li>
<li><p>Updated Jasper library to version 1.900.1.</p></li>
<li><p>Updated jbigkit to 1.6</p></li>

<li><p>Updated zlib to 1.2.3.</p></li>
<li><p>Libtiff supports LZW compression.</p></li>
<li><p>X11 is no longer part of the default build and will not be included
in the distributed install packages (but can still be built).</p></li>
<li><p>Find latest Ghostscript which idenfies itself as &quot;GPL Ghostscript&quot;.</p></li>
<li><p>Use GlobalMemoryStatusEx(), if available, to determine how much
physical memory is available. Important for large-memory machines.</p></li>
<li><p>Fixed NTreaddir() so that it does not write beyond its buffer.</p></li>
<li><p>Fixed opendir() emulation function so it can't overwrite the stack.</p></li>
<li><p>FlashPIX library sources are no longer distributed in the Windows
source package and building FlashPIX is disabled by default.
FlashPIX may still be built by adding the library (separately
distributed).</p></li>

<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id49">1.1 (Released April 4, 2004)</a></h1>
<p>Bug fixes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Semaphore fix which is necessary for proper multi-threaded operation.</p></li>
<li><p>Configure script fix to ensure that -lfpx is not supplied to the C
compiler during subsequent tests since this fails on some systems.</p></li>
<li><p>Fix for East and West gravity computations.</p></li>
<li><p>System error reports (errno) associated with an exception are now
correctly obtained from the context existing when the exception was
thrown rather than the context of the reporting function.</p></li>
<li><p>JNG encoder fix. Files were being written with incorrect
alpha_sample_value in the header. These can be repaired by reading
them into GM 1.1 and rewriting them.</p></li>
<li><p>XPM fix to module registration.</p></li>
<li><p>PSD fix for index calculation when QuantumDepth&gt;8.</p></li>
<li><p>Validate that geometry specifications only include allowed
characters.</p></li>
<li><p>SGI fix to save compression type while writing.</p></li>
<li><p>EXIF attributes were not being retrieved when requested.</p></li>
<li><p>Fix for bug when reading an image via a user-provided file
descriptor.</p></li>
<li><p>The reported image magick string is now always that of the original
input file (it was sometimes being reported as the format produced by
an intermediate delegate program).</p></li>
<li><p>Fixes to color profiling of CMYK images.</p></li>
<li><p>Memory leak fixed in DrawClipPath().</p></li>
<li><p>Arc drawing is fixed.</p></li>
<li><p>Command-line parsing bug under Linux due to Linux's sscanfs
inability to parse strings like &quot;0x1&quot; as &quot;%fx%f&quot; is fixed.</p></li>
<li><p>Scaling of 5 and 6-bit colors was slightly incorrect in BMP, AVI,
DIB, and TIM datastreams.</p></li>
<li><p>GM utility now reports an error rather than silently returning if
an unsupported sub-command is provided.</p></li>
<li><p>TIFF coder was writing 16-bit per sample RGB images incorrectly on
little-endian CPUs.</p></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Performance improvements:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Texture tiling is now 7X faster.</p></li>
<li><p>Color profile processing speed improvements for colormapped images.</p></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Utilities enhancements:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>For Unix, 'gm version' now includes a dump of the configure and
build parameters.</p></li>
<li><p>Logging of thrown exceptions is now supported. Use '-debug
exception'. This is useful to learn when and where errors are
reported.</p></li>
<li><p>The -define option is added in order to support supplying
additional options to coders without needing to add additional
command line options or structure members.</p></li>
<li><p>The output of 'gm identify -verbose' now provides a nice dump
of EXIF data.</p></li>
<li><p>The -sampling-factor option now accepts as many HxV pairs as
there are JPEG components.  Omitted ones default to 1x1.</p></li>
<li><p>The convert and montage commands now support an -operator command to
perform arithmetic and bitwise operations on specified image channels.</p></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Coder additions/improvements</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The META coder supports wide characters for the IPTC and 8BIM
formats.</p></li>
<li><p>The XTRN coder now supports wide characters.</p></li>
<li><p>An &quot;IMAGE&quot; coder is provided which provides access to a large
number of images (derived from XFig) suitable for use as patterns,
or as test images.</p></li>
<li><p>The &quot;PATTERN&quot; coder now returns an image pattern tiled to size
(equivalent results to TILE:IMAGE:pattern). This is for ImageMagick
compatibility.</p></li>
<li><p>The CINEON coder now supports reading and writing images in CINEON
&quot;CIN&quot; linear gray and RGB formats. The read support is still very
weak, but it works for common images.</p></li>
<li><p>The JPEG coder now estimates the original JPEG quality and sampling
factors and will reuse these options when writing JPEG if the image
is of the same type and the option &quot;-define JPEG:preserve-settings&quot;
is supplied.</p></li>
<li><p>The JPEG-2000 coder now supports all Jasper library arguments using
command line syntax similar to '-define jp2:rate=0.5'.</p></li>
<li><p>Reading and writting compressed SVG (SVGZ) is now supported.</p></li>
<li><p>The TXT coder now observes depth when writing.</p></li>
<li><p>The TIFF coder now outputs colormapped images with 1, 2, 4, and 8
bits per sample in order to provide much smaller file sizes for
images with very few colors.</p></li>
<li><p>Many TIFF coder enhancements. Now reads colormapped and grayscale
images at arbitrary (even odd) bits-per-sample sizes. Now properly
supports an opacity channel (at any bits-per-sample value) for
grayscale images. Bilevel grayscale images are treated similar to any
other grayscale image unless CCITT FAX3/FAX4 compression is
requested. Now allows the user to specify an arbitrary
bits-per-sample value for grayscale images (even odd values) using
&quot;-define tiff:bits-per-sample=value&quot;. Now automatically stores the
image as TrueColor RGB pixels if the image compression is set to JPEG.
TIFF files are now written in using the TIFF library's default endian
order rather than always big endian.</p></li>
<li><p>The WPG coder now renders embedded WMFs.</p></li>
<li><p>The PS3 coder is completely re-written to work much better and
support more features (see ChangeLog).</p></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Code structure enhancements:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Error handling has been improved and validated through testing.
Some errors were being lost, unnecessarily ignored, or reported as
something else entirely.</p></li>
<li><p>The number of error text messages to be maintained has been reduced
by consolidating similar messages.</p></li>
<li><p>The memory allocator functions have been replaced with similar
macros in order to eliminate warnings with GCC 3.3, avoid
accidentally casting away const, and allow memory debuggers to
report memory allocations and frees against the correct functions.
The previously-used functions remain in the library for the purpose
of compatibility.</p></li>
<li><p>&lt;magick/xwindow.h&gt; no longer depends on magick_config.h defines.</p></li>
<li><p>The text string localization code has been replaced with a simpler
version written by Bill Radcliffe.</p></li>
<li><p>Added key,value &quot;map&quot; APIs (somewhat similar to C++'s &lt;map&gt;) for
internal use.</p></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>API enhancements:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Incorporated John Cristy's Wand API's in a new GraphicsMagickWand
library.</p></li>
<li><p>API definition is no longer dependent on types which vary in size
(e.g. size_t) depending on large file compilation options.  This means
that applications may now be compiled without any special large file
options and still work properly with the library.</p></li>
<li><p>Thrown exceptions (ExceptionInfo structure) now include source
file, source line, function name, and current system error number.</p></li>
<li><p>The GetMagickInfoArray() function is added to replace use of
GetMagickInfo() for code which needs to access the coder list. This
is necessary since invoking GetMagickInfo() may re-order the coder
list, causing problems for code which traverses the list. Using
GetMagickInfo() to access individual list elements is safe.</p></li>
<li><p>Added the CopyException function to support copying exception info
from one structure to another.</p></li>
<li><p>Added the ReplaceImageInList function to replace an image in an
image list.</p></li>
<li><p>Added the DrawPeekGraphicContext function to access the current
DrawInfo structure in the drawing context stack. Use of this
function is not recommended since it voilates proper programming
practices. It is added to support the Wand API's.</p></li>
<li><p>GetImageDepth() now returns an integral value between 1 and
QuantumDepth and is no longer limited to the values 8, 16, and 32.</p></li>
<li><p>SetImageDepth() supports setting the image modulus depth to any
integral value between 1 and QuantumDepth. This effects the effective
numeric precision, not the storage depth, since the quantum storage
type is still a Quantum.</p></li>
<li><p>GetImageChannelDepth() supports retrieving the modulus depth for a
specified channel.</p></li>
<li><p>SetImageChannelDepth() supports setting the modulus depth for a
specified channel.</p></li>
<li><p>ProfileImage is updated to handle alpha channels and grayscale
images.</p></li>
<li><p>Added GetImageProfile() to retrieve a CMS profile from an image.</p></li>
<li><p>Added SetImageProfile() to attach a CMS profile to an image without
adjusting the image pixels.</p></li>
<li><p>Added DeleteImageProfile() to remove a CMS profile from an image.</p></li>
<li><p>ConstituteImage() and DispatchImage() now support 'T' (transparency),
'O' (opacity), and 'P' (pad) options.</p></li>
<li><p>CompositeImage() now supports CopyCyanCompositeOp,
CopyMagentaCompositeOp, CopyYellowCompositeOp, and
CopyBlackCompositeOp, composition operators.</p></li>
<li><p>GetColorHistogram() obtains a color histogram for the image.</p></li>
<li><p>QuantumOperatorImage() and QuantumOperatorRegionImage() support
arithmetic and bitwise operations on specified image channels.</p></li>
<li><p>The semaphore.h header is no longer installed or included in the
API headers since these functions are private interfaces.</p></li>
<li><p>Configure using --enable-symbol-prefix or define
PREFIX_MAGICK_SYMBOLS to use the C preprocessor to prefix all library
symbols with &quot;Gm&quot;. This prevents library symbol conflicts with other
libraries.</p></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>PerlMagick fixes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Adjusted a number of function option names so that they match the
documentation.</p></li>
<li><p>Memory leak fixed.</p></li>
<li><p>Reading files (e.g. GIF) via a file descriptor is fixed.</p></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Build improvements:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The TRIO library may be used to provide a replacement for vsnprintf
if the C library doesn't provide it.  This improves security on old
systems.</p></li>
<li><p>Configure only configures for C &amp; C++ languages.</p></li>
<li><p>Configure now does a better job of figuring out how to build a
thread-safe library across multiple operating systems.</p></li>
<li><p>Configure incorporates a new mmap() test which tests the
functionality which is needed so that mmap() is not unnecessarily
rejected on a number of systems. This improves performance for large
files on those systems.</p></li>
<li><p>Configure/build fixes for IBM's AIX operating system.</p></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Windows-specific improvements:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The static install package now uses the &quot;uninstalled&quot;

<li><p>Filter modules installed to lib/GraphicsMagick-1.0/modules-Q8/filters.</p></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Many performance enhancements:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Default QuantumDepth is 8 since this is adequate for most purposes
and more efficient than 16.</p></li>
<li><p>The Magick++ demo (compiled with QuantumDepth=8 and -O2) runs about
1.8X faster under SPARC/Solaris than the same demo with ImageMagick
5.5.4.</p></li>
<li><p>Colorspace transformations are much faster.</p></li>
<li><p>Grayscale/monochrome image handling is much faster.</p></li>
<li><p>PseudoClass image handling is faster.</p></li>
<li><p>Text annotations using FreeType are much faster.</p></li>
<li><p>Image file I/O is much faster.</p></li>
<li><p>RLE-compressed MIFF reading much faster.</p></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Code structure enhancements:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>All utility support functions moved to magick/command.c in order to
significantly reduce link dependencies, allowing statically-linked
programs to be smaller.</p></li>
<li><p>Use of MogrifyImage() eliminated except for by utilities.</p></li>
<li><p>Re-builds due to changes to &lt;magick/image.h&gt; reduced by splitting the
header into multiple headers.</p></li>
<li><p>ISO C '99 typedefs (gm_int16_t, gm_uint16_t, gm_int32_t, gm_uint32_t,
gm_int64_t, gm_uint64_t) are available for use.</p></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Feature enhancements:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Module loader always enabled for shared builds to allow extension.</p></li>
<li><p>Loading of arbitrary filter modules (via -process option) supported
under Unix as well as Windows.</p></li>
<li><p>SVG coder allows specifying size and initial background color.</p></li>
<li><p>JPEG-2000 coder (JP2) updated to work with Jasper 1.7.</p></li>
<li><p>HWB and HSL image colorspace translation support.</p></li>
<li><p>JNG/MNG/PNG format support tracks ImageMagick version.</p></li>
<li><p>BMP encoder can write 16-color indexed BMPs now as well as 2-color
BMPs (not restricted to monochrome).</p></li>
<li><p>TIFF decoder now includes optimized support for tiled and stripped
TIFF.</p></li>
<li><p>The -random-threshold option (RandomThresholdImage()) is added to
threshold an image to bilevel using random thresholding.</p></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Major bug fixes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>100% successful test completion at all quantum depths (8/16/32).</p></li>
<li><p>A temporary file management subsystem is added to ensure that all
temporary files are removed before program exit. Temporary files are
created and used in a secure fashion to avoid the possibility that a
&quot;trojan&quot; temporary file (e.g. a symbolic link, or a file containing
unsafe content) is created before a delegate has the chance to write
to it. The environment variable MAGICK_TMPDIR allows the user to
specify where temporary files are created without altering where
other programs create their temporary files. Temporary filenames are
created in 8+3 format to hopefully be more acceptable to ralcgm.</p></li>
<li><p>When dithering is disabled, don't dither when converting to a
PseudoClass, grayscale, or monochrome image. Disabling dithering
may cause these translations to be much faster.</p></li>
<li><p>PICON format works with BLOBs.</p></li>
<li><p>No longer removes input file when pinging a FlashPIX file.</p></li>
<li><p>Arc drawing and texture fill fixes from ImageMagick.</p></li>
<li><p>Sample, scale and affine fixes from ImageMagick.</p></li>
<li><p>MIFF colormaps are now scaled properly while reading.</p></li>
<li><p>CMYK translation works for QuantumDepth=32.</p></li>
<li><p>ConstituteImage now works properly for grayscale images.</p></li>
<li><p>Built-in tilde expansion and filename globbing now works properly.</p></li>
<li><p>InitializeMagick now registers signal handlers to ensure that
resources are released before program exit.  This helps avoid
temporary file leaks due to the user using &quot;CONTROL-C&quot;.</p></li>
<li><p>The installed &lt;magick/magick_config.h&gt; header now only contains
the few definitions required by the API headers.  This should
significantly reduce or eliminate conflicts with other package
headers.</p></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Windows platform enhancements:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Configure updated for Visual C++ 7.0.</p></li>
<li><p>OLE object (ImageMagickObject) re-written to work with Visual C++ 7.0</p></li>
<li><p>New function, CropImageToHBITMAP(), to return a region of the image
as a Windows HBITMAP.</p></li>
<li><p>Use vsnprintf to format strings under Windows (safer).</p></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>On November 19, 2002, GraphicsMagick was created as a fork of
ImageMagick, several days before the ImageMagick 5.5.2 release.</p>
<p>The objectives of GraphicsMagick are to:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Use an open development model.</p></li>
<li><p>Encourage new developers to join the project.</p></li>
<li><p>Avoid unnecessary source code &quot;churn&quot;.</p></li>
<li><p>Establish and preserve a stable API.</p></li>
<li><p>Use efficient coding practices which result in fast code.</p></li>
<li><p>Improve memory efficiency.</p></li>
<li><p>Use a release process which assures a working product.</p></li>
<li><p>Maintain an accurate ChangeLog.</p></li>
</ul>
