<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id1">Archive Formats</a></h1>
<p>GraphicsMagick is distributed in a number of different archive formats.
The source code must be extracted prior to compilation as follows:</p>
<p>7z</p>
<blockquote>
<p>7-Zip archive format. The Z-Zip format may be extracted under Unix
using '7za' from the P7ZIP package (<a class="reference external" href="http://p7zip.sourceforge.net/">http://p7zip.sourceforge.net/</a>).
Extract similar to:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">7za x GraphicsMagick-1.3.7z</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>.tar.bz2</p>
<blockquote>
<p>BZip2 compressed tar archive format. Requires that both the bzip2
(<a class="reference external" href="http://www.sourceware.org/bzip2/">http://www.sourceware.org/bzip2/</a>) and tar programs to be available. Extract
similar to:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">bzip2 -d GraphicsMagick-1.3.tar.bz | tar -xvf -</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>.tar.gz</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Gzip compressed tar archive format. Requires that both the gzip
(<a class="reference external" href="http://www.gzip.org/">http://www.gzip.org/</a>) and tar programs to be available. Extract
similar to:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">gzip -d GraphicsMagick-1.3.tar.gz | tar -xvf -</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>.tar.lz</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lzip compressed tar archive format.  Requires that both the lzip
(<a class="reference external" href="http://lzip.nongnu.org/lzip.html">http://lzip.nongnu.org/lzip.html</a>) and tar programs to be
available. Extract similar to:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">lzip -d -c GraphicsMagick-1.3.tar.gz | tar -xvf -</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>.tar.xz</p>
<blockquote>
<p>LZMA compressed tar archive format. Requires that LZMA utils
(<a class="reference external" href="http://tukaani.org/lzma/">http://tukaani.org/lzma/</a>) and tar programs to be available. Extract
similar to:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">xz -d GraphicsMagick-1.3.tar.xz | tar -xvf -</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>zip</p>
<blockquote>
<p>PK-ZIP archive format. Requires that the unzip program from Info-Zip
(<a class="reference external" href="http://www.info-zip.org/UnZip.html">http://www.info-zip.org/UnZip.html</a>) be available. Extract similar to:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">unzip GraphicsMagick-1.3.zip</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The GraphicsMagick source code is extracted into a subdirectory
similar to 'GraphicsMagick-1.3'. After the source code extracted,
change to the new directory (using the actual directory name) using
a command similar to:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">cd GraphicsMagick-1.3</pre>
</section>
<section id="build-configuration">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id2">Build Configuration</a></h1>
<p>Use 'configure' to automatically configure, build, and install
GraphicsMagick. The configure script may be executed from the
GraphicsMagick source directory (e.g ./configure) or from a separate
build directory by specifying the full path to configure (e.g.
/src/GraphicsMagick-1.3/configure). The advantage of using a separate
build directory is that multiple GraphicsMagick builds may share the
same GraphicsMagick source directory while allowing each build to use a
unique set of options.  Using a separate directory also makes it easier
to keep track of any files you may have edited.</p>
<p>If you are willing to accept configure's default options (static
build, 8 bits/sample), and build from within the source directory,
type:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">./configure</pre>
<p>and watch the configure script output to verify that it finds everything
that you think it should. If it does not, then adjust your environment
so that it does.</p>
<p>If you are attempting to build a maximally-static build, then
use --disable-shared and execute configure like:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">PKG_CONFIG='pkg-config --static' ./configure</pre>
<p>By default, 'make install' will install the package's files
in '/usr/local/bin', '/usr/local/man', etc. You can specify an
installation prefix other than '/usr/local' by giving 'configure'
the option '--prefix=PATH'.  This is valuable in case you don't have
privileges to install under the default paths or if you want to install
in the system directories instead.</p>
<p>If you are not happy with configure's choice of compiler, compilation
flags, or libraries, you can give 'configure' initial values for
variables by specifying them on the configure command line, e.g.:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">./configure CC=c99 CFLAGS=-O2 LIBS=-lposix</pre>
<p>Options which should be common to packages installed under the same
directory hierarchy may be supplied via a 'config.site' file located
under the installation prefix via the path ${prefix}/share/config.site
where ${prefix} is the installation prefix. This file is used for all
packages installed under that prefix. As an alternative, the CONFIG_SITE
environment variable may be used to specify the path of a site
configuration file to load. This is an example config.site file:</p>
<pre class="literal-block"># Configuration values for all packages installed under this prefix
CC=gcc
CXX=c++
CPPFLAGS='-I/usr/local/include'
LDFLAGS='-L/usr/local/lib -R/usr/local/lib'</pre>
<p>When the 'config.site' file is being used to supply configuration
options, configure will issue a message similar to:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">configure: loading site script /usr/local/share/config.site</pre>
<p>The configure variables you should be aware of are:</p>
<p>CC</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Name of C compiler (e.g. 'cc -Xa') to use</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CXX</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Name of C++ compiler to use (e.g. 'CC')</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CFLAGS</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Compiler flags (e.g. '-g -O2') to compile C code</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CXXFLAGS</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Compiler flags (e.g. '-g -O2') to compile C++ code</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CPPFLAGS</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Include paths (-I/somedir) to look for header files</p>
</blockquote>
<p>LDFLAGS</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Library paths (-L/somedir) to look for libraries Systems that
support the notion of a library run-path may require an additional
argument in order to find shared libraries at run time. For
example, the Solaris linker requires an argument of the form
'-R/somedir', some Linux systems will work with '-rpath /somedir',
while some other Linux systems who's gcc does not pass -rpath to
the linker require an argument of the form '-Wl,-rpath,/somedir'.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>LIBS</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Extra libraries (-lsomelib) required to link</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Any variable (e.g. CPPFLAGS or LDFLAGS) which requires a directory
path must specify an absolute path rather than a relative path.</p>
<p>The build now supports a Linux-style &quot;silent&quot; build (default
disabled).  To enable this, add the configure option
--enable-silent-rules or invoke make like 'make V=0'.  If the build
has been configured for silent mode and it is necessary to see a
verbose build, then invoke make like 'make V=1'.</p>
<p>Configure can usually find the X include and library files
automatically, but if it doesn't, you can use the 'configure' options
'--x-includes=DIR' and '--x-libraries=DIR' to specify their locations.</p>
<p>The configure script provides a number of GraphicsMagick specific
options.  When disabling an option --disable-something is equivalent
to specifying --enable-something=no and --without-something is
equivalent to --with-something=no.  The configure options are as
follows (execute 'configure --help' to see all options).</p>

<p>Normally support for being able to read and write gzip/bzip stream
files (files which are additionally compressed using gzip or bzip)
is a good thing, but for some formats it is necessary to
decompress an entire input file before it may be validated and
read.  Decompressing the file may take a lot of time and disk
space.  If input files are not trustworthy, an apparently small
file can take much more resources than expected.  Use this option

<p>GraphicsMagick options represent either features to be enabled, disabled,
or packages to be included in the build.  When a feature is enabled (via
--enable-something), it enables code already present in GraphicsMagick.
When a package is enabled (via --with-something), the configure script
will search for it, and if is is properly installed and ready to use
(headers and built libraries are found by compiler) it will be included
in the build.  The configure script is delivered with all features
disabled and all packages enabled. In general, the only reason to
disable a package is if a package exists but it is unsuitable for
the build (perhaps an old version or not compiled with the right
compilation flags).</p>
<p>Several configure options require special note:</p>
<dl class="option-list">
<dt><kbd><span class="option">--enable-shared</span></kbd></dt>
<dd><p>The shared libraries are built and support for loading coder and
process modules is enabled. Shared libraries are preferred because
they allow programs to share common code, making the individual
programs much smaller. In addition shared libraries are required in
order for PerlMagick to be dynamically loaded by an installed PERL
(otherwise an additional PERL (PerlMagick) must be installed. This
option is not the default because all libraries used by
GraphicsMagick must also be dynamic libraries if GraphicsMagick
itself is to be dynamically loaded (such as for PerlMagick).</p>
<p>GraphicsMagick built with delegates (see MAGICK PLUG-INS below)
can pose additional challenges. If GraphicsMagick is built using
static libraries (the default without --enable-shared) then
delegate libraries may be built as either static libraries or
shared libraries. However, if GraphicsMagick is built using shared
libraries, then all delegate libraries must also be built as
shared libraries.  Static libraries usually have the extension .a,
while shared libraries typically have extensions like .so, .sa,
or .dll. Code in shared libraries normally must compiled using
a special compiler option to produce Position Independent Code
(PIC). The only time this is not necessary is if the platform
compiles code as PIC by default.</p>
<p>PIC compilation flags differ from vendor to vendor (gcc's is
-fPIC). However, you must compile all shared library source with
the same flag (for gcc use -fPIC rather than -fpic). While static
libraries are normally created using an archive tool like 'ar',
shared libraries are built using special linker or compiler options
(e.g. -shared for gcc).</p>
<p>Building shared libraries often requires subtantial hand-editing
of Makefiles and is only recommended for those who know what they
are doing.</p>
<p>If --enable-shared is not specified, a new PERL interpreter
(PerlMagick) is built which is statically linked against the
PerlMagick extension. This new interpreter is installed into the
same directory as the GraphicsMagick utilities. If --enable-shared
is specified, the PerlMagick extension is built as a dynamically
loadable object which is loaded into your current PERL interpreter
at run-time. Use of dynamically-loaded extensions is preferable over
statically linked extensions so --enable-shared should be specified
if possible (note that all libraries used with GraphicsMagick must
be shared libraries!).</p>
</dd>
<dt><kbd><span class="option">--disable-static</span></kbd></dt>
<dd><p>static archive libraries (with extension .a) are not built. If you
are building shared libraries, there is little value to building
static libraries. Reasons to build static libraries include: 1) they
can be easier to debug; 2) the clients do not have external
dependencies (i.e. libMagick.so); 3) building PIC versions of the
delegate libraries may take additional expertise and effort; 4) you
are unable to build shared libraries.</p>
</dd>
<dt><kbd><span class="option">--disable-installed</span></kbd></dt>
<dd><p>By default the GraphicsMagick build is configured to formally install
into a directory tree. This is the most secure and reliable way to
install GraphicsMagick. Specifying --disable-installed configures
GraphicsMagick so that it doesn't use hard-coded paths and locates
support files by computing an offset path from the executable (or
from the location specified by the MAGICK_HOME environment variable.
The uninstalled configuration is ideal for binary distributions which
are expected to extract and run in any location.</p>
</dd>
<dt><kbd><span class="option">--enable-broken-coders</span></kbd></dt>
<dd><p>The implementation of file format support for some formats is
incomplete or imperfectly implemented such that file corruption or a
security exploit might occur.  These formats are not included in the
build by default but may be enabled using
<span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--enable-broken-coders</span></span>.  The existing implementation may still
have value in controlled circumstances so it remains but needs to be
enabled.  One of the formats currently controlled by this is Adobe
Photoshop bitmap format (PSD).</p>
</dd>
<dt><kbd><span class="option">--with-modules</span></kbd></dt>
<dd><p>Image coders and process modules are built as loadable modules which
are installed under the directory
[prefix]/lib/GraphicsMagick-X.X.X/modules-QN (where 'N' equals 8, 16,
or 32 depending on the quantum depth) in the subdirectories 'coders'
and 'filters' respectively. The modules build option is only
available in conjunction with --enable-shared. If --enable-shared is
not also specified, then support for building modules is disabled.
Note that if --enable-shared is specified, the module loader is
active (allowing extending an installed GraphicsMagick by simply
copying a module into place) but GraphicsMagick itself is not built
using modules.</p>
<p>Use of the modules build is recommended where it is possible to use
it.  Using modules defers the overhead due to library dependencies
(searching the filesystem for libraries, shared library relocations,
initialized data, and constructors) until the point the libraries
are required to be used to support the file format requested.
Traditionally it has been thought that a 'static' program will be
more performant than one built with shared libraries, and perhaps
this may be true, but building a 'static' GraphicsMagick does not
account for the many shared libraries it uses on a typical
Unix/Linux system.  These shared libraries may impose unexpected
overhead.  For example, it was recently noted that libxml2 is now
often linked with the ICU (international character sets) libraries
which are huge C++ libraries consuming almost 30MB of disk space and
that simply linking with these libraries causes GraphicsMagick to
start up much more slowly. By using the modules build, libxml2 (and
therefore the huge ICU C++ libraries) are only loaded in the few
cases (e.g. SVG format) where it is needed.</p>
<p>When applications depend on the GraphicsMagick libraries, using the
modules build lessens the linkage overhead due to using
GraphicsMagick.</p>
</dd>
<dt><kbd><span class="option">--enable-symbol-prefix</span></kbd></dt>
<dd><p>The GraphicsMagick libraries may contain symbols which conflict with
other libraries. Specifify this option to prefix &quot;Gm&quot; to all library
symbols, and use the C pre-processor to allow dependent code to still
compile as before.</p>
</dd>
<dt><kbd><span class="option">--enable-magick-compat</span></kbd></dt>
<dd><p>Normally GraphicsMagick installs only the 'gm' utility from which all
commands may be accessed. Existing packages may be designed to invoke
ImageMagick utilities (e.g. &quot;convert&quot;). Specify this option to
install ImageMagick utility compatibility links to allow
GraphicsMagick to substitute directly for ImageMagick. Take care when
selecting this option since if there is an existing ImageMagick
installation installed in the same directory, its utilities will be
replaced when GraphicsMagick is installed.</p>
</dd>
<dt><kbd><span class="option">--with-quantum-depth</span></kbd></dt>
<dd><p>This option allows the user to specify the number of bits to use per
pixel quantum (the size of the red, green, blue, and alpha pixel
components. When an image file with less depth is read, smaller
values are scaled up to this size for processing, and are scaled
down from this size when a file with lower depth is written.  For
example, &quot;--with-quantum-depth=8&quot; builds GraphicsMagick using 8-bit
quantums. Most computer display adaptors use 8-bit
quantums. Currently supported arguments are 8, 16, or 32.  The
default is 8. This option is the most important option in
determining the overall run-time performance of GraphicsMagick.</p>
<p>The number of bits in a quantum determines how many values it may
contain. Each quantum level supports 256 times as many values as
the previous level. The following table shows the range available
for various quantum sizes.</p>
<blockquote>
<table>

<p>Larger pixel quantums cause GraphicsMagick to run more slowly and to
require more memory. For example, using sixteen-bit pixel quantums
causes GraphicsMagick to run 15% to 50% slower (and take twice as
much memory) than when it is built to support eight-bit pixel
quantums.  Regardless, the GraphicsMagick authors prefer to use
sixteen-bit pixel quantums since they support all common image
formats and assure that there is no loss of color precision.</p>
<p>The amount of virtual memory consumed by an image can be computed
by the equation (QuantumDepth*Rows*Columns*5)/8. This is an
important consideration when resources are limited, particularly
since processing an image may require several images to be in
memory at one time. The following table shows memory consumption
values for a 1024x768 image:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>GraphicsMagick performs all image processing computations using
floating point or non-lossy integer arithmetic, so results are very
accurate.  Increasing the quantum storage size decreases the amount
of quantization noise (usually not visible at 8 bits) and helps
prevent countouring and posterization in the image.</p>
<p>Consider also using the --enable-quantum-library-names configure
option so that installed shared libraries include the quantum depth
as part of their names so that shared libraries using different
quantum depth options may co-exist in the same directory.</p>

--without-threads.  Testing shows that the overhead from thread

dependent).  Normally support for large files is a good thing.  Only
disable this option if there is a need to do so.</p>
</dd>
<dt><kbd><span class="option">--disable-openmp</span></kbd></dt>
<dd><p>By default, GraphicsMagick is compiled with support for OpenMP
(<a class="reference external" href="http://www.openmp.org/">http://www.openmp.org/</a>) if the compilation environment supports it.
OpenMP automatically parallelizes loops across concurrent threads
based on instructions in pragmas. OpenMP was introduced in GCC
4.2. OpenMP is a well-established standard and was implemented in
some other compilers in the late '90s, long before its appearance in
GCC. OpenMP adds additional build and linkage requirements.
GraphicsMagick supports OpenMP version 2.0 and later, primarily
using features defined by version 2.5, but will be optionally using
features from version 3.1 in the future since it is commonly
available.</p>
<p>By default, GraphicsMagick enables as many threads as there are CPU
cores (or CPU threads).  According to the OpenMP standard, the
OMP_NUM_THREADS environment variable specifies how many threads
should be used and GraphicsMagick also honors this request. In order
to obtain the best single-user performance, set OMP_NUM_THREADS
equal to the number of available CPU cores.  On a server with many
cores and many programs running at once, there may be benefit to
setting OMP_NUM_THREADS to a much smaller value than the number of
cores, and sometimes values as low as two (or even one, to disable
threading) will offer the best overall system performance.  Tuning a
large system with OpenMP programs running in parallel (competing for
resources) is a complex topic and some research and experimentation
may be required in order to find the best parameters.</p>
</dd>
<dt><kbd><span class="option">--enable-openmp-slow</span></kbd></dt>
<dd><p>On some systems, memory-bound algorithms run slower (rather than
faster) as threads are added via OpenMP.  This may be due to CPU
cache and memory architecture implementation, or OS thread API
implementation.  Since it is not known how a system will behave
without testing and pre-built binaries need to work well on all
systems, these algorithms are now disabled for OpenMP by default.
If you are using a well-threaded OS on a CPU with a good
high-performance memory architecture, you might consider enabling
this option based on experimentation.</p>

PerlMagick is no longer installed by GraphicsMagick's ''make
install''.  The procedure to configure, build, install, and check
PerlMagick is described in PerlMagick/README.txt.  When using a
shared library build of GraphicsMagick, it is necessary to formally
install GraphicsMagick prior to building PerlMagick in order to
achieve a working PerlMagick since otherwise the wrong
GraphicsMagick libraries may be used.</p>
<p>If the argument ''--with-perl=/path/to/perl'' is supplied, then
/path/to/perl will be taken as the PERL interpreter to use. This is
important in case the 'perl' executable in your PATH is not PERL5,
or is not the PERL you want to use.  Experience suggests that static
PerlMagick builds may not be fully successful (at least for
executing the test suite) for Perl versions newer than 5.8.8.</p>
<p>As a convenience, the Makefile targets 'perl-build',
'install-exec-perl', and 'perl-check' are provided.  In order to
assure that library dependencies and search paths are correct, it is
necessary to first install GraphicsMagick via 'make install', then
build PerlMagick using 'make perl-build', then install PerlMagick
using 'sudo make install-exec-perl', and then 'make perl-check' to
make sure that it actually works.</p>

GraphicsMagick's installation prefix is not the same as PERL's
PREFIX, then you may find that PerlMagick's 'make install' step tries
to install into a directory tree that you don't have write
permissions to. This is common when PERL is delivered with the
operating system or on Internet Service Provider (ISP) web servers.
If you want PerlMagick to install elsewhere, then provide a PREFIX
option to PERL's configuration step via
&quot;--with-perl-options=PREFIX=/some/place&quot;. Other options accepted by

PerlMagick under Cygwin because Cygwin does not provide the libperl.a
static library required to create a static PerlMagick.  Note that
older Cygwin compilers may not generate code which supports reliably

<pre class="literal-block">./configure '--host=x86_64-w64-mingw32' '--disable-shared'</pre>
<p>For a full-fledged GraphicsMagick program, normally one will want to
pre-install or cross-compile the optional libraries that
GraphicsMagick may depend on and install them where the cross-compiler
will find them, or add extra <cite>CPPFLAGS</cite> and <cite>LDFLAGS</cite> options so that
the compiler searches for header files and libraries in the correct
place.</p>
<p>Configuring for building with shared libraries (libGraphicsMagick,
libGraphicsMagickWand, and libGraphicsMagick++ DLLs) and modules

<cite>--with-modules</cite> modules option.</p>
<p>After configuring the software for cross-compilation, the software is
built using <cite>make</cite> as usual and everything should be as with native
compilation except that <cite>make check</cite> is likely not available (testing
might be possible on build system via WINE, not currently
tested/supported by GraphicsMagick authors).</p>
<p>Use of the <cite>DESTDIR</cite> approach as described in the <a class="reference internal" href="#build-install">Build &amp; Install</a>

<section id="dealing-with-configuration-failures">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id11">Dealing with configuration failures</a></h1>
<p>While configure is designed to ease installation of GraphicsMagick, it
often discovers problems that would otherwise be encountered later
when compiling GraphicsMagick. The configure script tests for headers
and libraries by executing the compiler (CC) with the specified
compilation flags (CFLAGS), pre-processor flags (CPPFLAGS), and linker
flags (LDFLAGS). Any errors are logged to the file 'config.log'. If
configure fails to discover a header or library please review this
log file to determine why, however, please be aware that <em>errors
in the config.log are normal</em> because configure works by trying
something and seeing if it fails. An error in config.log is only a
problem if the test should have passed on your system. After taking
corrective action, be sure to remove the 'config.cache' file before
running configure so that configure will re-inspect the environment
rather than using cached values.</p>
<p>Common causes of configure failures are:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>A delegate header is not in the header include path (CPPFLAGS -I
option).</p></li>
<li><p>A delegate library is not in the linker search/run path (LDFLAGS
-L/-R option).</p></li>
<li><p>A delegate library is missing a function (old version?).OB</p></li>
<li><p>The compilation environment is faulty.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>If all reasonable corrective actions have been tried and the problem
appears to be due to a flaw in the configure script, please send a
bug report to the configure script maintainer (currently
<a class="reference external" href="mailto:bfriesen&#37;&#52;&#48;graphicsmagick&#46;org">bfriesen<span>&#64;</span>graphicsmagick<span>&#46;</span>org</a>). All bug reports should contain the
operating system type (as reported by 'uname -a') and the
compiler/compiler-version. A copy of the configure script output
and/or the config.log file may be valuable in order to find the
problem. If you send a config.log, please also send a script of the
configure output and a description of what you expected to see (and
why) so the failure you are observing can be identified and resolved.</p>

requirement is 128MB for the Q8 build, or 256MB for the Q16
build, or 512MB for the Q32 build.</p>

<p>'make clean'</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Remove everything in the build directory created by 'make'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>'make distclean'</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Remove everything in the build directory created by 'configure'
and 'make'. This is useful if you want to start over from scratch.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>'make uninstall'</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Remove all files from the system which are (or would be) installed
by 'make install' using the current configuration. Note that this
target does not work for PerlMagick since Perl no longer supports
an 'uninstall' target.</p>

<p>To confirm your installation of the GraphicsMagick distribution was
successful, ensure that the installation directory is in your executable
search path and type</p>
<pre class="literal-block">gm display</pre>
<p>The GraphicsMagick logo should be displayed on your X11 display.</p>
<p>Verify that the expected image formats are supported by executing</p>
<pre class="literal-block">gm convert -list formats</pre>
<p>Verify that the expected fonts are available by executing</p>
<pre class="literal-block">gm convert -list fonts</pre>
<p>Verify that delegates (external programs) are configured as expected
by executing</p>
<pre class="literal-block">gm convert -list delegates</pre>
<p>Verify that color definitions may be loaded by executing</p>
<pre class="literal-block">gm convert -list colors</pre>
<p>If GraphicsMagick is built to use loadable coder modules, then verify
that the modules load via</p>
<pre class="literal-block">gm convert -list modules</pre>
<p>Verify that GraphicsMagick is properly identifying the resources of
your machine via</p>
<pre class="literal-block">gm convert -list resources</pre>
<p>For a thorough test, you should run the GraphicsMagick test suite by
typing</p>
<pre class="literal-block">make check</pre>
<p>Note that due to differences between the developer's environment and
your own, it is possible that some tests may be indicated as failed
even though the results are ok.  Such failures should be rare, and if
they do occur, they should be reported as a bug.  Differences between
the developer's environment environment and your own may include the
compiler, the CPU type, and the library versions used. The
GraphicsMagick developers use the current release of all dependent
libraries.</p>
